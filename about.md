I am currently working for [TELOGIC](http://www.telogic.com.sg) as the software engineer.

Before I come onboard with [TELOGIC](http://www.telogic.com.sg), I was a junior software developer in [REALWAT.INC](http://www.realwat.com) where I started to learn how to engineer the code.

Besides these, I am a husband, a father, a brother, and a friend.

I like trying new stuff and making things work.

Find me on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/varmansvn) if you've got questions.
